A Mesosphere eCommerce platform.

Follow progress at [livecoding.tv](https://livecoding.tv/kodraus)

I'm going to be taking some old eCommerce code I've accumulated over the last few years and rebuilding it using a microservices architecture.

I'll be going through:

- [DNX](http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/dnx/overview.html)
- [Mesosphere](https://mesosphere.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)

# current setup
- Mono 4.3.0
- DNX 1.0.0-beta6 mono
- C# 5
 
# pull requests
At this early stage I'm not really looking for pull requests or feature requests, but once there's enough of a codebase to make the projects intentions clear they will be most welcome!
